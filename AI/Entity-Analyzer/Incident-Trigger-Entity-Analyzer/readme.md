# Multi-Entity Analyzer - Microsoft Sentinel Playbook

Activating the 'Deploy' button initiates the deployment of an Azure Logic App integrated with Security Copilot Actions, utilizing a Microsoft Sentinel incident trigger.
The Logic App is configured to run when a new incident is created in Sentinel. This Logic App automatically analyzes all URL and User entities within the incident and provides detailed security insights including classification, analysis results, and recommendations for each entity type.

The playbook automatically triggers when:
- A new incident is created in Microsoft Sentinel
- The incident contains URL entities that need security analysis
- The incident contains User/Account entities that require behavioral analysis
- Security analysts need comprehensive automated analysis of multiple entity types

After the analysis is complete, Security Copilot conducts a comprehensive investigation of each entity type and automatically adds detailed comments to the incident with:
- **URL Analysis**: Security classification, threat intelligence, and URL reputation analysis
- **User Analysis**: Behavioral analysis, risk assessment, and user activity patterns
- **Classification**: Security classification for each entity
- **Analysis Results**: Detailed security analysis findings for each entity
- **Recommendations**: Security recommendations based on the analysis
- **Disclaimer**: AI-generated analysis disclaimer

### Prerequisites

Prior to beginning the installation process, it's crucial to confirm that you have met the following prerequisites:
- The user deploying this Logic App needs to have a **Contributor Role**
- You have enabled the **Security Copilot license** on your tenant
- The user has permissions to access **Microsoft Sentinel** workspace
- The **SentinelMCP connector** is available in your environment
- The Logic App will automatically use the workspace ID from the incident trigger

### Parameters

During deployment, you'll need to provide:
- **PlaybookName**: Name for the Logic App (default: "Entity-Analyzer-Incident-Trigger")
- **lookBackDays**: Number of days to look back for entity analysis (default: 60 days)

### Deployment 

To deploy the Multi-Entity Analyzer Logic App:
1. Press on the Deploy button below
2. Select your subscription and resource group (use the same tenant where Security Copilot is enabled)
3. Configure the lookBackDays parameter if needed (default is 60 days)
4. The workspace ID will be automatically retrieved from the incident

### Post Deployment

After successful deployment:
- The Logic App will be automatically enabled and ready to use
- **Authenticate the connections**: Go to the Logic App ‚Üí API connections and authenticate:
  - **Microsoft Sentinel connection**: Authenticate with a user that has Sentinel permissions
  - **SentinelMCP connection**: Authenticate with Security Copilot permissions
- The playbook will automatically trigger when new incidents are created
- **Manual execution**: You can also run this playbook manually from the incident page
- **Automation Rule**: Consider creating an automation rule to run this playbook automatically on specific incident types

### How It Works

1. **Trigger**: The Logic App triggers when a new incident is created in Microsoft Sentinel
2. **Entity Extraction**: The playbook extracts all URL and User entities from the incident
3. **Parallel Analysis**: 
   - **URLs**: Each URL is analyzed for security threats, reputation, and classification
   - **Users**: Each user account is analyzed for behavioral patterns and risk assessment
4. **Processing**: The analysis results are formatted with emojis and proper formatting
5. **Output**: Separate detailed comments are added to the incident for each analyzed entity:
   - One comment per URL entity analyzed
   - One comment per User entity analyzed

### Sample Output

The playbook generates formatted comments in the incident for each entity type:

**URL Analysis Output:**
```
üîó URL Analysis for: https://example.com

üè∑Ô∏è Classification
Malicious/Suspicious/Benign

üîç Analysis Result
Detailed security findings and threat intelligence

‚úÖ Recommendation
Security recommendations and next steps

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
ü§ñ AI-generated analysis notice
```

**User Analysis Output:**
```
üë§ User Analysis for: john.doe@company.com

üè∑Ô∏è Classification
High Risk/Medium Risk/Low Risk

üîç Analysis Result
Behavioral analysis and activity patterns

‚úÖ Recommendation
User security recommendations

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
ü§ñ AI-generated analysis notice
```

### Use Cases

This playbook is ideal for:
- **Automated Incident Enrichment**: Automatically analyze all entities when incidents are created
- **Phishing Investigations**: Analyze suspicious URLs and affected users simultaneously
- **Insider Threat Detection**: Comprehensive user behavior analysis
- **Malware Investigations**: URL reputation analysis combined with user impact assessment
- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: Reduce manual analysis time and improve response speed

### Automation Integration

- **Manual Execution**: Run from the incident page when needed
- **Automation Rules**: Create rules to trigger automatically based on:
  - Incident severity levels
  - Specific alert types
  - Entity types present in the incident
  - Custom conditions

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure both API connections are properly authenticated
- Check that Security Copilot is enabled and accessible
- Confirm the SentinelMCP connector is available in your region
- Verify the Logic App has proper permissions to read incident entities
- Check that the incident contains URL or User entities for analysis
- Review the Logic App run history for any failed executions

### Performance Notes

- The playbook processes entities in parallel for faster execution
- Each entity type (URL/User) is analyzed separately
- Large incidents with many entities may take longer to process
- Consider the lookBackDays parameter impact on analysis depth and performance
